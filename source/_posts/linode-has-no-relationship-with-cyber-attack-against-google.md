Linode是最好的VPS提供商之一，之前有人说中国黑客入侵Google等公司服务器的时候用的是Linode的服务器，Linode官方博客刚刚发表文章，澄清说：
> “有些媒体在报道中国黑客攻击Google等互联网公司事件的时候，有提到Linode。事实上，Linode的VPS并未被黑客利用来做坏事，而是Google选择我们帮助他们进行调查。Google认可本文陈述。”
<!--more-->原文如下：
> Recent media coverage of cyber attacks appearing to originate from China against Google and other companies have mentioned a Linode VPS being involved.  No Linodes were involved in malicious activity related to this event.  In fact, it was Google themselves that chose to use Linode to aid in their investigation of the attacks.  Google has authorized us to release this statement:
> 
> <span style="color: #993300;">“Google signed up to become the operator of the VPS on Jan. 1, 2010 for the purposes of an investigation. At no point did malicious parties have control.” – Jay Nancarrow, Google Global Communications &amp; Public Affairs</span>
> 
> Although our part was a small one, we’re glad to have been a component in this investigation. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to contact us.
